This is an 🤖 Android app to check the validity of a South African ID number

## 🧃 Project Motivation
It is a costly affair when having to check an ID number. And so, before attempting to do so, you can save some money by first checking if the ID number is valid before querying it against the Home Affairs API.

## 🗺️ How to
- Download the apk to your Android mobile device.
- Install the app. You will be prompted to scan the app. Scan it! and then select install.
- Launch app, and enter the ID number. The submit button will highlight once all the numbers have been entered.
- The result will be displayed beneath the submit button.

# 🧯 !!! IMPORTANT !!!
Never use an ID number written on paper. Always use a copy of the original ID or the original ID itself.
